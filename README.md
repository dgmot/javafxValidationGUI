This is a general GUI prototype for validating a fictitious device system.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the combined use of java and fxml. 

The program has a few fields which the user must manually fill.
After clicking the "Validate" button the controller checks for each field and validates it according with 
the field label description. After the validation is done the program simulates a test where it succeeds if
a random generated number, is between 85 and 140.
